%\section{Appendix A: How to use the Modelbase software}
\begin{center}
{\Large \textbf{Macroeconomic Model Data Base 3.1 - User Guide } }
\par\end{center}


\vspace{1.5cm}


\noindent This user guide describes how to install and use the Macroeconomic Model Data Base, version 3.1 (hereafter the Modelbase or MMB). Section 1 deals with the installation and the software requirements.
Section 2 introduces the menu of the MMB 3.1 and describes how to run the software and conduct comparison exercises employing the models and options contained in the Modelbase.
Section 3 explains the structure of the key files that govern the simulations carried out by the MMB 3.1. 
Section 4 lays out the structure of the model files. These are usual Dynare files, which have been amended with extra lines and commands to suit the MMB. Also, the structure of json files is explained here.
Lastly, section 5 deals with adding a model to the MMB, while section 6 deals with adding a monetary policy rule to the MMB.
This guide is platform independent and can be applied to Windows, Linux and macOS operating systems.
