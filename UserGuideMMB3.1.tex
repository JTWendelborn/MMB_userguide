%\section{Appendix A: How to use the Modelbase software}
\begin{center}
{\Large \textbf{Macroeconomic Model Data Base 3.1 - User Guide } }
\par\end{center}


\vspace{1.5cm}


This user guide describes how to install and use the Macroeconomic Model Data Base, version 3.1 (hereafter the Modelbase). Section 1 deals with the installation and the software requirements.
Section 2 introduces the menu of the MMB 3.1 and describes how to run the software and conduct comparison exercises employing the models and options contained in the Modelbase.
Section 3 explains the structure of the key files that govern the simulations carried out by the MMB 3.1. Lastly, section 4 lays out the structure of the model files. These are usual Dynare files, which have been amended with extra lines and commands to suit the MMB.
For the time being we exclude instructions on how to alter the MMB by adding models or policy rules, which are planned to be included in the next release.

This guide is platform independent and can be applied to Windows, Linux and macOs operating systems.
