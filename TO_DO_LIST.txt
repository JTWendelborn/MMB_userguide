TO DO LIST MMB_USERGUIDE:

- check what we already have
- check what needs to be added
- maybe check with Gregor what the new features are:
	- new common variables 
	- parameter setting in adaptive learning models
	- [gregor:] browse & edit models from within GUI
			-> done
			-> [Alex:] Reload Data may have a bug for renaming shocks (see issue on git mmb-gui-electron) 
	- [gregor:] display model specific vars & shocks
			-> done
	- [gregor:] scan for octave/matlab & dynare, set path, check compatibility
			-> done
	
Changes that need to be made:

- Chapter 1: Installation and software requirements:
	- adjust compatibility
	- maybe check whether the list of models that cannot be run in Octave has changed
		-> done
		-> Please check if there is stll a problem for EA_Q14 for Octave 4.4.0
	
- Chapter 2: The Modelbase: Models, Rules and Options:
	-> AL info 
	- adjust options for AL models
	- monetary policy rules: adjust number of how many models have a model-specific rule


	- maybe check whether the list of models that cannot be run in Octave has changed
		-> see above
	- check which of the mentioned options are actually reintroduced 
		* [gregor:] should be all of them. If not, please let me know
			-> [Alex:] I had problems with showing variances, then nothing was plotted at all. 
				It is the same as issue #51 by Joans (I will check again before I open an issue!)
	
- Chapter 3: Structure of the Modelbase
	-> done

	- Is the folder MMB_OPTIONS still relevant?
		* [gregor:] nope. Doesn't exist anymore.
	- Which KEY FILES should be included?
		* [gregor:] what do you mean?
			-> [jonas:] in chapter 3 there is a section "Some Key Files", featuring CMB_MMB.m, MMB_settings.m and MSR_COEFFS.m
			   			as the MMB_OPTIONS folder doesn't exist anymore, I suppose these files are also not relevant anymore
			   			-> should we include other files (and which ones) that are essential for the MMB in this section?
			-> [Alex:] I talked to Balint. The .m fles you mention are from an earlier version of the MMB. In 3.1 we only need 
						the .json and .mod file (and maybe the _steadystate.m file)
		
- ADD CHAPTER ON ADDING AND MODIFYING MODELS
	-> Done

- Chapter 4: Structure of the model files	
	-> done
	* [gregor:] and in particular on the JSONs, but I think this was implied


Check rule numbers (and msr coeffiecients) if time allows!
	-> rule numbers done
