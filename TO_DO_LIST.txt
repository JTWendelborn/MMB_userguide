TO DO LIST MMB_USERGUIDE:

- check what we already have
- check what needs to be added
- maybe check with Gregor what the new features are:
	- new common variables 
	- parameter setting in adaptive learning models
	- [gregor:] browse & edit models from within GUI
	- [gregor:] display model specific vars & shocks
	- [gregor:] scan for octave/matlab & dynare, set path, check compatibility
	
Changes that need to be made:

- Chapter 1: Installation and software requirements:
	- adjust compatibility
	- maybe check whether the list of models that cannot be run in Octave has changed
	
- Chapter 2: The Modelbase: Models, Rules and Options:
	- maybe check whether the list of models that cannot be run in Octave has changed
	- check which of the mentioned options are actually reintroduced 
		* [gregor:] should be all of them. If not, please let me know
	- adjust options for AL models
	- monetary policy rules: adjust number of how many models have a model-specific rule
	
- Chapter 3: Structure of the Modelbase
	- Is the folder MMB_OPTIONS still relevant?
		* [gregor:] nope. Doesn't exist anymore.
	- Which KEY FILES should be included?
		* [gregor:] what do you mean?
			-> [jonas:] in chapter 3 there is a section "Some Key Files", featuring CMB_MMB.m, MMB_settings.m and MSR_COEFFS.m
			   			as the MMB_OPTIONS folder doesn't exist anymore, I suppose these files are also not relevant anymore
			   			-> should we include other files (and which ones) that are essential for the MMB in this section?
		
- ADD CHAPTER ON ADDING AND MODIFYING MODELS

- Chapter 4: Structure of the model files	
	* [gregor:] and in particular on the JSONs, but I think this was implied
